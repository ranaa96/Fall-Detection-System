---------------------------
The idea is to serve elderly people who need care in nursing home so that they may be exposed to a heart attack or a fainting or falling and possible to die and no one will reach them until its too late. We use 
1-wifi module 
2- fall detection sensor 
3- push button (emergency response)
 All of these data are sent to a server .

This project brings support for ESP8266 chip to the Arduino environment. It lets you write sketches using familiar Arduino functions and libraries, and run them directly on ESP8266, no external microcontroller required.
